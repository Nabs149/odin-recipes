    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
        <li>⅔ cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>½ pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
    </ol>
